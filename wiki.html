                Asgard was the centrepiece of the Norse Gods' civilisation and
                the final home for only the greatest warriors who ever lived; a
                place where they could eat, drink, revel and fight for eternity,
                until Ragnarök came. On that day, it was prophesied that the
                giants will breach Asgard and give their lives annihilating the
                entire Norse pantheon. Odin blocked access to it from the rest
                of the world; as such little was known of the realm by most
                people but the Aesir could come and go from it as they please.
                The homes of the Aesir were surrounded by the giant Walls of
                Asgard. The realm was destroyed due to events of Ragnarök, which
                began earlier than expected due to Kratos killing Baldur. While
                Kratos and his allies were able to defeat Odin and his forces,
                the fire giant Surtr whom Kratos had helped transform into
                Ragnarök itself proved unstoppable and ended up destroying
                Asgard. Some pieces of the destroyed realm crashed into the
                other eight realms.

                Upon first arriving in Alfheim you'd be forgiven for thinking
                that it was nicer than Midgard with its lush forest terrain,
                tranquil waters and initially peaceful atmosphere. Then you
                witness a group of Dark Elves massacre a group of Light Elves
                and you realise that there's been a never-ending war raging here
                for longer than anyone can remember for no reason other than
                both sides want the other dead. Chief and greatest among the
                realm's landmarks is the legendary Light of Alfheim, which both
                sides fight to control. When the dark elves are in charge the
                light barely comes out as a trickle as they horde it all inside
                of Freyr's Temple. When Light Elves rule the realm the light
                shines bright like a tower into the sky. Don't be surprised when
                the Dark Elves attack you immediately; they are by nature a
                vicious and cruel race who kill outsiders indiscriminately while
                the Light Elves are mostly peaceful and stand-offish but still
                somewhat unsettling. The land itself is dominated by the temple
                and the Light though there are ruins lining the outskirts that
                contain valuable treasures.

                Perhaps most appropriate for the ancestral realm of the giants,
                Jötunheim features the tallest mountains in all the nine realms,
                which gives you an apt view to the numerous giant corpses that
                litter the realm for all to see. No one lives here anymore, the
                only thing left of arguably the wisest among the races of the
                nine realms is an endless landscape of smaller mountain ranges
                and, more ghoulishly, giant bodies and a temple speaking of the
                life of the Jötnar's avenger Loki. Treasure the sights of the
                realm while you can because once you leave it, you'll never be
                able to get back into it again. There are no enemies here so
                take your time and relax.

                By far the most mysterious, bizarre and unearthly of the Nine
                Realms, Vanaheim is an endless expanse of bright and
                darkly-colourful forests and shining lakes where wild magic runs
                amok and the very air is filled with disembodied voices. It is
                the homeland of the Vanir tribe of gods, the greatest rivals of
                the Aesir tribe of gods and treacherous for any besides them.
                The exact layout of this realm is currently unknown. Whereas the
                Aesir's power is purely elemental, blunt and militaristic, the
                Vanir are highly skilled in numerous forms of magic and their
                ethereal realm is a reflection of this. It is impossible to
                enter this realm without their permission, a fact that
                frustrates Odin to no end and trying to sneak in or break in is
                both unwise and extremely dangerous, for you.

                Midgard is essentially a middle ground of sorts among the
                various realms, no pun intended; while not nearly as freezing as
                Helheim or Niflheim, it is still very cold. It is a vast,
                sprawling landscape of dense forests, snow-capped mountains
                laced with elaborate tunnel systems, intricate waterways and
                numerous ruins left over from various human and non-human
                civilisations. The realm as a whole is dominated by the famous
                Lake of Nine, a massive lake in the centre of the realm upon
                which Tyr's Temple is located. If you were hoping to run into
                actual people in this realm don't hold your breath; in the wake
                of an undead scourge triggered by the sealing away of the
                Valkyries by Odin, all living people have either fled or gone
                into hiding. It is perfect for exploring and general wandering
                and makes for some breathtaking scenery so don't be in such a
                hurry to make your way through it. The enemies, while standard,
                become more challenging as you level up but as long as you keep
                your wits about you and fight smart, you should have no problem
                navigating this realm.

                The ancestral homeland of the Dwarves, one of the most wiley,
                inventive and cunning races in the Nine Realms; Svartalfheim's
                exact layout is unknown as it is off-limits to anyone except
                dwarves including the Aesir; a rare reward from Odin as payment
                for services rendered by the Dwarves for his tribe in ages past.
                It is here that the Dwarves greatest creations are given shape
                and form, from weapons and machines to objects that are
                literally defined as Impossible, such is the skill of the
                inhabitants. Don't bother trying to enter; aside from being
                obviously impossible, Dwarves aren't exactly the most welcoming
                bunch and while they aren't violent by nature, they are
                legendary for holding grudges and you don't want them as an
                enemy under any circumstances.

                A small but deceptively dangerous realm covered in magical mists
                and at one time home to a breakaway colony of dwarves led by
                their great craftsman Ivaldi. A maze that constantly rearranges
                itself every time someone enters is the Dwarfs greatest
                testament to their craft. The cursed fog born of Odin's wrath
                that slowly drains the life of everyone who steps inside of it
                is testament to their greatest failure. To survive in this realm
                requires expert timing, fast combat skills and of course the
                magical armour sets crafted by Sindri to shield you temporarily
                from the life-draining mists. Enemies of all types abound in
                this place including another Valkyrie so be on your guard at all
                times. This is also by far the most frustrating realm in that
                however much you may want to keep going, you will lose
                everything you gained if you die in the maze and have to start
                all over again.

                A land of primordial fire and blistering heat home to a tribe of
                slumbering fire giants, Muspelheim is an unending landscape of
                lava flows, volcanic ash clouds and noticeable signs of giant
                activity from ages past, though today it is completely lifeless.
                Its ruler Surtr, the original fire giant, has not been seen or
                heard from in millennia; he too is presumed to be slumbering
                deep within Muspelheim's fiery crust until the time of Ragnarok
                comes, whereupon Sutr and the other fire giants will rise again
                to lead all giants into battle against the gods. His famous
                sword can be seen embedded in the peak of the realm's highest
                and most powerful volcano next to the slumbering Valkyrie of
                Fire Gondul, who was imprisoned there by the Valkyrie Queen
                Sigrun. It is in this realm that the greatest warriors of all
                time are challenged to test their skills in a series of
                gruelling battles against beasts, monsters and warriors of the
                Nine Realms. Enter at your own peril.

                Helheim, also known as Hel, is the primary Norse afterlife in
                the God of War series. It is the realm where people go when they
                die and is also where certain deities of the universe reside.
                Unlike Valhalla, which is reserved solely for those who have
                died 'honorably' in combat, Helheim houses the vast majority of
                the rest of the universe's more neutral inhabitants. i.e. those
                who die of purely natural causes such as old age, or sickness,
                as well as unnatural deaths such as those who are victims of
                murder and suicide. As if the freezing winds cold enough to
                encase your very soul in ice wasn't bad enough, those who find
                themselves here are tormented by their greatest regrets in life
                via illusions airing their misdeeds for others to judge for
                themselves. Hel-Walkers roam this realm unfettered tormenting
                the dead for sport. Your axe is next to useless in this freezing
                realm and you will have to rely heavily on your Chaos Blades in
                combat. Its ruler Hel is a no-show for reasons unknown, though
                there is the small matter of the unnamed, gigantic bird-being at
                the end of the Bridge that does nothing but float there and
                stare at you creepily if you come close to it.
